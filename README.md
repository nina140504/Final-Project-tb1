### About the project ☀️
For the final project of our TechBasics course we're creating a basic digital board game inspired by the popular game Mario Party with a summery vacation theme. Location of our game is the island Madeira where the player can choose one out of five characters, that are ready for an eventful adventure on the island. The player moves around the island where fun and tropical mini games wait for the player. Some of the mini games include a cocktail-themed memory-game 🍸, a suitcase sorting game 🧳 or a fun underwater catfish escape game 🦈. The goal is to reach as many points as possible within 5 rounds (each round counted when one minigame is completed) - all the scores from the games and the interactive map fields will be added up in the end. 

### Playing instructions
To start the game run the **main_menu.py** file - the following files will then start automatically. To end the game close the window.

### Licensing
All music and sound files used in this project are royalty-free files. The images used to generate the characters with ai were all publicly available.

### About the programmers 🍹
We're Finja & Nina, Leuphana students studying Digital Media, both in desperate need for a vacation - that's how the idea for this game was created :). This project is part of our course TechBasics I that teaches easy programming for beginners.
